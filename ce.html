        <p>The Department of Civil Engineering specializes in structural design, urban planning, and sustainable infrastructure.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Civil Engineering Department is a foundational branch of engineering dedicated to the design, construction, and maintenance of infrastructure essential for societal development. It focuses on creating sustainable, safe, and functional structures while addressing environmental and economic considerations. Key highlights include:</p>
        
        <h3>Core Areas of Focus:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Structural Engineering:</strong> Design and analysis of buildings, bridges, and other load-bearing structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Geotechnical Engineering:</strong> Study of soil and foundation systems for safe and stable construction.</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation Engineering:</strong> Development of efficient transportation systems like roads, railways, and airports.</li>
            <li><strong>Environmental Engineering:</strong> Management of water resources, waste treatment, and environmental conservation.</li>
            <li><strong>Construction Management:</strong> Planning, execution, and supervision of construction projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydraulics and Water Resources:</strong> Design of dams, canals, and water distribution systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Practical Learning:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hands-on training in surveying, material testing, and design software (e.g., AutoCAD, STAAD Pro).</li>
            <li>Field visits to construction sites and projects.</li>
            <li>Internships in infrastructure development, urban planning, and construction firms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Interdisciplinary Opportunities:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Collaboration with mechanical and environmental engineering for sustainable infrastructure.</li>
            <li>Integration with IT and GIS (Geographical Information Systems) for smart city planning.</li>
        </ul>
